- 👋 Hi, I’m @MauricioShiguemoto
- 👀 I'm interested in helping humanity have a good place for self-development wherever they are.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... I don't know if this is the right question. Anywhere or anytime it's time to learn something. You can think about your week and be glad for it. You'll learn to be happy and greatfull about the things you have and who you are!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Cloud architecture, software architecture, Computer vision and IA...  
- 📫 How to reach me: shiguemoto.m@gmail.com.
